"Below you can find some instructions on how to use the SO Simple Gallery "
"plugin."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:18
msgid ""
"With the SO Simple Gallery plugin you can upload up to 8 images per gallery."
"<br />I have restricted the maximum number of uploads, because it is a "
"vertically oriented plugin and beyond 8 images it rapidly becomes not so "
"nice looking."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:19
msgid ""
"The plugin uses a script that dynamically resizes the images, so you do not "
"have to worry whether or not your images are suitable for use."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:20
msgid ""
"The only thing you need to keep in mind is the <strong>minimum width</"
"strong> of the images you plan to use;<br />this is: 800 pixels."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:22
msgid ""
"The plugin adds <i class=\"dashicons-images-alt2\"></i> <em>Simple "
"Galleries</em> to your sidebar under the Media menu."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:23
msgid ""
"Via that menu you can see all your existing Simple Galleries and Add a New "
"Simple Gallery."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:24
msgid ""
"You can give your Simple Gallery a title and then start uploading your "
"images.<br />You can choose your images from the Media Library or Upload "
"them from your computer."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:25
msgid ""
"After saving the Simple Gallery, you will see the shortcode you can use in "
"the message that informs you that the gallery has been published or saved."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:26
msgid ""
"You can also find the shortcode per Simple Gallery on the main Simple "
"Galleries admin screen."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:27
msgid ""
"Once you have added one or more Simple Galleries it is time to add it/them "
"to your content."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:28
msgid ""
"For that I have made a simple to use shortcode button available that you "
"will see if you are using the Visual Editor."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:33
msgid ""
"If you click that button it will automatically insert the following "
"shortcode:<br /><code>[so-simple-gallery id=\"\"]</code>"
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:34
msgid ""
"Now here is where you need to input the ID number of the Gallery you want to "
"show, like:<br><code>[so-simple-gallery id=\"123\"]</code> (where 123 is the "
"ID number of your Simple Gallery)."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:35
msgid ""
"If you are not using the Visual Editor, you can just copy the shortcode from "
"the individual gallery, the main simple galleries screen or from the above "
"example and add it to your HTML content."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:36
msgid ""
"If you want to include the shortcode in one of your template files, then you "
"need to use the shortcode like this:<br><code>&lt;?php echo "
"do_shortcode( '[so-simple-gallery id='123']' ); ?&gt;</code> where 123 is "
"the ID of your Simple Gallery."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:38
msgid "Known Limitations"
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:40
msgid ""
"The SO Simple Gallery looks best with a maximum of 5 landscape images OR "
"when using portrait style image between 6 and 8 images.<br />Mixing portrait "
"and landscape image in one gallery is <strong>not a good idea</strong>."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:41
msgid ""
"If you are uploading images with different sizes then it is best to put the "
"shortest images as the top image.<br />The reason for that is that the first "
"image always shows (to create the placeholder image), so even when you hover "
"over the other images, that first image is still there.<br />This can be "
"solved with some javascript, but I first want to see if there are enough "
"people that like this plugin, before I develop it further."
msgstr ""

#: admin/settings.php:42
msgid ""
"I have not yet included any Options to change things like size, background "
"color, text color, add titles and what not.<br />Again I would like to wait "
"and see if there are enough people that like this plugin, before I develop "
"it further."
msgstr ""
